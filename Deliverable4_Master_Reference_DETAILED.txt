Deliverable 4 – Comprehensive Standalone Reference Document
1. Document Purpose and Usage
This document is designed as a fully standalone master reference that encapsulates all necessary information originally distributed across the Initial Plan, SRS A/B, and SPMP documents. Its sole purpose is to enable the complete and correct creation of Deliverable 4 (Software Design Description – SDD) when provided together with the project source code.

No other project documentation is required. Any AI, instructor, or evaluator using this document should assume that all omitted documents are fully represented here.
2. Project Identity and Context
Project Name: Customizable ERP Provider
Software Product Name: CustomERP
Team: Team 10
Academic Course: CTIS 411 – Senior Project
Institution: Bilkent University
Academic Advisor: Dr. Cüneyt Sevgi

CustomERP is an AI-assisted web-based platform that enables non-technical users to generate custom ERP systems by describing their business processes in natural language.
3. Product Vision and Objectives (Initial Plan Derived)
The project addresses the gap between rigid template-based ERP systems and costly custom-developed solutions. The primary objective is to demonstrate that AI can translate human-readable business descriptions into functional ERP components.

Key objectives include:
• Parsing business descriptions with acceptable semantic accuracy
• Automatically generating inventory-centered data models
• Producing working CRUD-based modules
• Delivering a deployable prototype within a short time frame
4. Development Model and Increment Strategy (SPMP Derived)
The project follows a customized Scrum-based incremental development model. Each increment delivers a self-contained, testable subset of system functionality.

Deliverable 4 exclusively focuses on the First Increment.
5. Increment Scope Definition (Critical for SDD)
First Increment Scope:
• Natural language requirement intake
• Input validation
• AI-based entity and attribute extraction
• Inventory module generation
• User review and approval
• Artifact export

Explicitly Out of Scope:
• Customer module implementation
• Invoicing logic
• Multi-tenant deployment
• Advanced analytics
6. User Characteristics and Design Implications (SRS Derived)
Primary users are small and medium-sized business owners or managers with no technical background. They are assumed to be unfamiliar with databases, schemas, APIs, or software configuration.

Design implications:
• Minimal configuration
• Guided interactions
• Plain language feedback
• Error prevention over error recovery
7. Functional Capability Summary (SRS A/B Consolidated)
The system shall:
• Accept and validate natural language input
• Perform semantic analysis via AI services
• Generate inventory-focused schemas
• Create CRUD interfaces
• Support iterative clarification
• Allow explicit user approval
• Export generated system artifacts
8. Non-Functional Requirements and Design Drivers
Usability: Wizard-based UI, clarification loops
Performance: Asynchronous AI processing
Security: Encrypted communication with external services
Portability: Generated artifacts runnable independently
Maintainability: Layered separation of concerns
9. High-Level Architecture Description
The system adopts a layered architecture consisting of:
• Presentation Layer
• Application/Service Layer
• AI Integration Layer
• Data Persistence Layer

This structure directly supports usability, portability, and security requirements.
10. Logical System Flow
1. User submits business description
2. System validates input
3. AI service extracts entities and relationships
4. Clarification loop resolves ambiguities
5. System Definition File is generated
6. User reviews and approves
7. Artifacts are exported
11. Data Design Assumptions
The logical data model focuses on inventory management. Entities include Product, Stock, Supplier, Transaction, User, and Role. Relationships follow normalized relational principles while remaining simple enough for automated generation.
12. Deployment and Physical View
The prototype is deployable as a standalone web application. External AI services are accessed via secure APIs. No permanent cloud infrastructure is required for execution.
13. Design Quality and Verification Strategy
Each non-functional requirement is addressed by explicit architectural decisions. Verification is achieved through unit, integration, system, and acceptance testing.
14. Testing Approach Summary
• Unit Tests: Core services
• Integration Tests: AI interaction
• System Tests: End-to-end use cases
• Acceptance Tests: User scenarios
15. Low-Level Design Expectations (First Increment Only)
The SDD shall include:
• Pseudocode for AI processing and clarification logic
• UML Sequence and Activity diagrams for UC-1 to UC-3
• Design-level UML Class diagrams reflecting the implemented code
16. Codebase Assumptions
The provided source code fully implements the architecture and behaviors described herein. AI integration may be real or mocked. Inventory functionality is complete and operational.
17. GitHub and Traceability
Version control history is used to demonstrate individual contribution and increment progress. Advisors and instructors have read access.
18. Final Instruction
When generating Deliverable 4 (SDD), treat this document as the single source of truth. Do not reference Initial Plan, SRS, or SPMP documents.
