# CustomERP

An AI-powered platform that automatically generates customized ERP systems from natural language business descriptions.

## Overview

CustomERP bridges the gap between expensive custom ERP development and inflexible template solutions by using artificial intelligence to translate plain English business descriptions into functional Enterprise Resource Planning systems. Small and medium-sized businesses can describe their operations in natural language, and the platform automatically generates database schemas, user interfaces, and complete ERP modules without requiring technical expertise or coding.

## Key Features

- **Natural Language Processing**: Describe your business processes in plain English
- **Automated Schema Generation**: AI identifies entities, relationships, and workflows from text descriptions
- **Instant Module Creation**: Automatically generates Customer Management, Inventory, and Invoicing modules
- **CRUD Interface Generation**: Creates complete data management interfaces without manual coding
- **Rapid Deployment**: Produces deployment-ready ERP systems within 4 hours
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Built-in user authentication and permissions management

## Project Status

This is an academic proof-of-concept project being developed as part of Bilkent University's CTIS Senior Project (October 2025 - June 2026). The system demonstrates the technical feasibility of AI-assisted ERP generation rather than being a production-ready commercial solution.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React with Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **AI Processing**: Anthropic Claude API
- **Deployment**: Docker
- **Version Control**: GitHub

## Architecture

The system consists of three primary components:

1. **AI Requirement Processor**: Parses natural language descriptions to extract business entities, relationships, and workflows
2. **Schema Generator**: Translates AI-interpreted requirements into database schemas and data models
3. **Module Generator**: Automatically creates CRUD interfaces and assembles ERP modules based on detected business needs

## Current Scope

The prototype focuses on three core modules:

- **Customer Management**: Contact information and interaction tracking
- **Inventory Management**: Product catalog and stock level management
- **Invoice Generation**: Line items, calculations, and document generation

## Development Timeline

- **October 2025**: Requirements analysis and initial planning
- **November 2025**: Requirements specification and prototyping
- **December 2025 - January 2026**: Architecture design and project management planning
- **February - May 2026**: Iterative implementation using Scrum methodology
- **May - June 2026**: Testing, validation, and final delivery
