- Briefly explain the functionalities provided by the product.
- Clearly indicate which use cases are implemented in the 1st Increment Prototype.

1.2 Selected Architecture
- Identify the software architecture(s) selected for the system.
- Justify the architecture choice by relating it to Non-Functional Requirements defined in SRS A v2.
- Discuss advantages and disadvantages of the selected architecture.
- Explain how the architecture affects the development process.

1.3 Logical View
- Draw a block diagram of the software architecture.
- Explain how the overall system functions and how components interact.
- Draw the EER diagram of the database using Chen notation.
- Include cardinalities, participation rules, inheritance, and attribute types.
- Narrate and explain the EER diagram.

1.4 Physical View
- Draw the UML Deployment Diagram of the system.
- Explain how software components are deployed and interact physically.

==============================
2. Design Quality
==============================

2. Design Quality
- For each Non-Functional Requirement defined in SRS A v2:

  - Explain how the requirement will be verified and validated.

==============================
3. Test Case Design
==============================

3.1 Unit Test Design

- Specify formatting rules for unit test cases.

3.2 Software Integration Test Design
- Explain the approach used to design integration test cases (if applicable).
- Specify formatting rules for integration test cases.

3.3 System Test Design
- Explain the approach used to design system test cases (if applicable).

- Draw UML Communication Diagrams for the 1st Increment use cases.
- Explain use case realizations.
- Provide detailed design diagrams (Activity, Sequence, Class diagrams as appropriate).
- If UML Class Diagrams are provided:
  - Include methods with parameters, visibility, and return types.
  - Include attributes with types, multiplicities, and visibility.
- Provide Unit Test Cases and 1st Increment Acceptance Test Cases based on the defined rules.
